        <p>Photography is a passion of mine which started after I used to accompany my uncle when I was younger on his random photo trips. Since then it has been something that I've kept up with on the side while going through school and work. On this site there will be a samples of my photos that I've taken over the past few trips. I hope you enjoy. - Cristian Fajardo</p>

        <h2>How I Choose What To Shoot</h2>
        <p>Usually I go to a local spot that has some nice architecture. I'm really more into taking photos of buildings or cool industrial art that just catches my eye. For example if you ever come to Miami, there are spots like Wynwood, Brickell and Miami Beach where you can find spots that have interesting architecture that builds on the cities history of having creative freedom.</p>
